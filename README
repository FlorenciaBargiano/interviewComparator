 You have been asked to take a list of contact information and identify which contacts are
 potentially duplicates. You need to write a function that will do the following:
 1. Identify which contacts are possible matches.
 2. Ascore for each match that represents how accurate you believe the match is. This
 scoring is defined by you.
 3. Acontact might have multiple or no matches
 4. All processing should be done in working memory (no database)

  As part of your solution you will need to produce:
  1. The code used to identify the potential duplicates
  2. Aset of tests that you use to verify the functions
  3. Comments in the code are welcome
